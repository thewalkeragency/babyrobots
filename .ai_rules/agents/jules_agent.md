- Testing Frameworks (Jest, Playwright)
- Package Managers (npm, yarn)

## Communication Protocol
- **Receives:** Asynchronous, well-defined tasks via GitHub Issues, typically assigned by Memex. The issue MUST contain all necessary context.
- **Outputs:**
    - Pull Requests containing the results of its work (e.g., new test files, updated dependencies, generated documentation).
    - Comments on GitHub Issues with status updates or reports.
- **Interacts With:** The GitHub repository. It operates mostly autonomously and does not require real-time interaction.
