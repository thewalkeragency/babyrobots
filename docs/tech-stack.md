# IndieLeap Platform: Proposed Technology Stack (Final Confirmed Version - April 14, 2025)

## I. Introduction

*   **Purpose:** This document defines and justifies the recommended technology stack for the IndieLeap platform. The objective is to establish a comprehensive, scalable, and future-proof foundation centered on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Firebase services. It is tailored to the unique needs of independent artists and the platform's planned features, including advanced AI-driven assistants, collaborative tools, and a rich artist studio, as outlined in the Functional Requirements Specification (FRS) [cite: IndieLeap Requirements Document Generation.docx].
*   **Scope:** The analysis covers frontend UI/UX, backend application logic/API (including browser automation and media processing), database storage, AI integration (LLMs, agent frameworks, specialized APIs), infrastructure/hosting, real-time capabilities, and WebGL integration.
*   **Core Priorities:** The technology selection prioritizes:
    *   Leveraging the robust **React 19** and **JavaScript/TypeScript** ecosystem.
    *   Maximizing the use of **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** and **Firebase** services for tight integration, scalability, and access to advanced AI capabilities.
    *   Utilizing **Cloud Firestore** as the core NoSQL database solution.
    *   Integrating Google's **Gemini** family of LLMs via **Vertex AI**, with **Imagen** as the primary image generation model.
    *   Employing **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)** (Python) and **Vertex AI Agent Builder** for AI agent development, focusing on A2A support.
    *   Incorporating **Google Cloud Transcoder API** for automated media processing.
    *   Using **Playwright** for **Browser Automation** to interact with essential third-party services lacking APIs.
    *   Complementing backend functions with self-hosted **n8n** for specific workflow automation.
    *   Utilizing **Tailwind CSS v4.1** for styling.
    *   Ensuring the architecture is robust, maintainable, and supports the specific needs of independent artists [cite: IndieLeap Requirements Document Generation.docx].
*   **Target Audience:** IndieLeap technical leadership (CTO, Tech Leads, Product Owners).

## II. Core Platform Architecture Overview

*   **Architectural Paradigm:** A hybrid approach using serverless and microservices principles, leveraging Google Cloud Functions / Cloud Run and Next.js API Routes within the Firebase ecosystem. Containerization via **Docker** is used for Cloud Run deployments.
    *   **Frontend:** React 19/Next.js hosted on Firebase Hosting (or Firebase App Hosting).
    *   **Backend API:** Primarily built using Next.js API Routes and Cloud Functions for Firebase (Node.js or Python runtime). Google Cloud Run used for containerized services (e.g., complex ADK agents in Python, Playwright browser automation, self-hosted n8n). Media processing handled via GCP Transcoder API triggered by backend events.
    *   **Database & Backend Services:** Firebase ecosystem (Firestore, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Storage, Firestore Realtime Listeners).
    *   **AI Platform:** Google Vertex AI (hosting Gemini models, Imagen models, Agent Builder, ADK Agent Engine).
    *   **Media Processing:** Google Cloud Transcoder API.
    *   **Browser Automation:** Playwright service running on Cloud Run.
    *   **Workflow Automation:** Self-hosted n8n (on Cloud Run) triggered via webhooks/API calls for specific integration workflows.
    *   **Infrastructure:** GCP and Firebase services, Docker for containerization.
*   **Rationale:** This maximizes Google service integration, offers pay-per-use scalability, enables necessary browser automation and media processing via dedicated services/APIs, allows visual workflow automation where beneficial (n8n), and manages deployment via standard container practices on Cloud Run using the latest stable versions of core frameworks.
